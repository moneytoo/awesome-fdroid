## About

It's not easy to discover great new apps on F-Droid without reviews or ~~download counts~~ ([F-Droid Stats](https://divested.dev/pages/fdroid_stats) using [F-Droid Metrics](https://f-droid.org/2021/03/01/fdroid-metrics-and-clean-insights.html)).

This table lists app repository star counts from GitHub, GitLab and Codeberg. Around 80% of F-Droid app source repositories are hosted on GitHub and about 10% on GitLab. The number of stars may not be the best signal, but at least it's something.

## Repositories

Currently, apps from these F-Droid repositories are included:

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repo)
* [F-Droid Archive](https://f-droid.org/archive)
* [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo)

## TODO

- [ ] Include data from [F-Droid Metrics](https://f-droid.org/2021/03/01/fdroid-metrics-and-clean-insights.html)
- [ ] Include download counts from Google Play for matching packages ([Google-Play-Scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper)?)
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions to automate updating
