## About

It's not easy to discover great new apps on F-Droid without reviews or download counts.

This table lists app repository star counts from GitHub and GitLab. Around 80% of F-Droid app source repositories are hosted on GitHub and about 10% on GitLab. The number of stars may not be the best signal but at least it's something.

## Repositories

Currently apps from these F-Droid repositories are included:

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repo)
* [F-Droid Archive](https://f-droid.org/archive)
* [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo)
